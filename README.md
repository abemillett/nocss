# nocss

A humble CSS reset designed to make otherwise un-styled markup look good and work well.

The developer short on time is now free from the hindrance of aesthetic concerns. You don't even have to bother with classes!

The designer short on time now has a _foundation_ upon which to _bootstrap_ a front-end project. Lightweight and hassle-free!

Using the (meyer reset)[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/] as a base and going from there.
